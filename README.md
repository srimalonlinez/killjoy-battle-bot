This project combines the power of ESP32-CAM, an ultrasonic sensor, and an electronic speed controller (ESC) to create a versatile robotic platform. The ESP32-CAM module is used for capturing and streaming video over HTTP, allowing remote control of the robot through a web interface. Additionally, an ultrasonic sensor is employed for obstacle detection, enabling the robot to autonomously navigate its environment. The ESC, controlled by the ESP32, provides smooth motor control, allowing for precise movement commands. With this setup, users can interact with the robot remotely, monitor its surroundings via live video feed, and enable autonomous navigation with obstacle avoidance capabilities.
